# TO DO LIST

1: get a release out

2: create a contributors.md to give recognition to those whose PRs I had to port manually due to git limitations. (they are not included in the contributor graph)

4: update tests to reflect changes, as not all prs included tests.

5: Investigate this pr: <https://github.com/twitter/twemoji/pull/638>
